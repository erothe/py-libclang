The repository contains code that taken from [the LLVM project][1], to make it easier to install
clang's python bindings.

The repository copys necessary Python binding files from LLVM repo, and adds packaging scripts
to make it a valid Python package, the uploads the package to [pypi][2]. To make the libclang
available without install the LLVM toolkits, this package provides bundled static-linked libclang
shared library for different platforms, which, should work well on OSX, Windows, as well as
usual Linux distributions.

The aim of this project is to make the `clang.cindex` (aka., Clang Python Bindings)
available for more Python users, without setup the LLVM environment. To install the package,
you just need to run

```bash
pip install libclang
```

Note that the library is named `libclang`, the package `clang` on PyPi is another package and
doesn't bundle the prebuilt shared library.

Internals
---------

Update class variable `library_path` of `Config` in `cindex.py` as:

```python
    library_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)), 'native')
```
